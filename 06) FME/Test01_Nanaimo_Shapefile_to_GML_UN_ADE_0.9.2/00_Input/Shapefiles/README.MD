NOTE: There are two subsets of data (shapefiles) for debugging the FME workbench. Both are storm sewers of Nanaimo, the only difference is that one of the subsets covers a larger area (a complete watershed).  

* Subset 1 (large): Pipes_subset + Appurtenances_subset

* Subset 2 (small): Pipes_subset_few_pipes + appurtenance_subset_few_pipes

From within the FME workbench one can decide which subset of pipes and appurtenances to process.
