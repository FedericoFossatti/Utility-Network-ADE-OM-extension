### Notes
The only files necessary for installation are the SQL scripts 01, 02, 03 and 05. The numbering is consistent with that by [Giorgio Agugiaro](https://github.com/gioagu/3dcitydb_utility_network_ade/tree/master/postgresql).  
The pdfs contain the entity-relationship diagram of the database, to help understand the dependencies.  
The restart file is given to hasten the clearing of the database in case of trialing the python scripts to load dummy attributes.
