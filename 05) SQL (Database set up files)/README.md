### Notes
The only files necessary for installation are the SQL scripts 01, 02, 03 and 05. File 06 is not 100% necessary, but useful. The numbering is consistent with that by [Giorgio Agugiaro](https://github.com/gioagu/3dcitydb_utility_network_ade/tree/master/postgresql).  
The pdfs contain two versions of the entity-relationship diagram of the database, to help understand the dependencies.
